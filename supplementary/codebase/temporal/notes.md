### Notes on the temporal exploration

We drive each of $C_a, g_s, K$ in an oscillatory fashion - sinusoidal for starters
We should choose a span of frequencies such that the physiologically relevant scales are represented

- $C_a$: not in nature, and maybe a transient ramping up is more suitable in context for gas exchange measurements
- $g_s$: longest time scale is 24 hrs. Compared to a typical timescale of diffusion $T=L^2/\langle D \rangle \simeq ...$ 
- $K$: flickering of light (super fast but also annually) and temperature (daily and annually)

Make sure to mativate when doing the final scan. For now search two orders of magnitude in both directions

#### On the importance of static $\delta, \kappa$ profiles

It turns out that the degree of contrast we choose matters A LOT 

Preliminary scans show that there is a switching point around 1:3 

We should produce scans above and below this point and discuss it

I now scan over rho-max and treat $\delta, \kappa$ as symmetric with $\rho_\lambda$ locked at 0.6 

*Full scan over rhomax, cases and quantities takes 25 min with 16 ranks*
